## Freelycomment

Freelycomment is a social network meant to enable users to comment on any website based on its url. It will also feature a browser extension and eventually a mobile app as well so users don't need to copy and paste the url in order to create a new post. A deployed preview version can be accessed in the following link https://tender-fermat-3d5fca.netlify.app/

## Tech Stack
Freelycomment is developed with React on the front-end using Redux-toolkit for state management and material-ui for styling. For the backend it uses express.js and the database is handled by MongoDb atlas. You can check the server-side code here https://github.com/ManuC84/server
